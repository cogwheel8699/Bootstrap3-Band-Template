# Band-Website

A simple rock band website I created to learn how to use Bootstrap. Website has been updated to Bootstrap 4 along with some visual improvements like importing Google Font, new email subscription section and removed the music player feature. 

The website was inspired by the website of the Irish band, "Walking on Cars" which has a similar layout.
