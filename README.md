# Band-Website

A simple rock band website I created to learn Bootstrap 3 back in 2016. Website has been updated to Bootstrap 4 along with some improvements like importing Google Font, new email subscription section and revamp of the members section. The music player now stays at the top left and with no autoplay feature. 

The website was inspired by an Irish band called "Walking on Cars", which had a similar layout at the time.
